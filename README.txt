This is the implementation of the AM-RBAC-SC model proposed by myself in my thesis, 2023.

This smart contract can perform access decisions about a user utilising the RBAC model. Furthermore, this contract applies user access monitoring to make contextualised access decisions based on previous user behaviours.

This Smart Contract was developed using the Remix IDE (version 1.3.6) and tested on the Ethereum virtual machines provided by the IDE. All tested versions of the smart contract were compiled with the solidity compiler (version 0.8.18+commit.87f61d96).
